Introduction
In this project, we aim to classify sonar signals from a dataset into two classes: rocks (R) and mines (M). We employ various machine learning models and techniques to achieve this classification task.

Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sonar-rock-vs-mine.git
cd sonar-rock-vs-mine
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Unzip and load the dataset:
The dataset is stored in a ZIP file. Extract it and load the CSV file into a DataFrame.

python
Copy code
import zipfile
import pandas as pd

# Unzipping the dataset
with zipfile.ZipFile('/path/to/archive.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall('/path/to/extract/folder')

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/extracted/dataset.csv', header=None)
Usage
After setting up, you can explore the Jupyter notebook (sonar_classification.ipynb) to understand the code and execute each cell sequentially.
