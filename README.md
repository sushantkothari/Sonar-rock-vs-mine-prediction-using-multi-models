# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction using Multi-Model Approach

## Overview

This project implements a multi-model approach to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data. It utilizes various machine learning algorithms to classify sonar signals, comparing their performance to identify the most effective model for this task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset, which contains patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder (mine) and a roughly cylindrical rock at various angles and under various conditions.

- Number of Instances: 208
- Number of Attributes: 60
- Target Classes: Rock (R) and Mine (M)

## Project Structure

The project follows this workflow:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
6. Model Comparison
7. Best Model Selection and Final Prediction

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Sonar_rock_vs_mine_prediction_using_multi_model.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

The project compares the performance of various models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best performing model is selected based on these metrics after hyperparameter tuning.
